## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

The thing who took me more time was try to center the component, I used flexbox but still don't undestand completly how it works, so there is a thing for more practice!

In this project is no necessary to use media queries, the design is perfect for mobile-first workflow and then just center the component.
